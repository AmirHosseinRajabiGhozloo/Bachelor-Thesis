Utilizing Machine Learning Methods to Estimate Permeability by Well Logging Logs

# Bachelor Thesis

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs offer valuable insights into critical reservoir characteristics, such as permeability, which are often challenging to obtain through conventional well logs. 
However, the widespread use of NMR logging tools is hindered by their high cost and operational limitations. 
This study introduces a machine learning (ML)-based approach designed for the rapid and accurate estimation of permeability derived from NMR using conventional logs. 
Through comprehensive preprocessing of the collected data, the procedure is trained and tested on a well log dataset, utilizing selected conventional logs as inputs and NMR-derived permeability as the target variable. 
Shallow and deep learning (DL) methods are employed to estimate permeability by artificially generating NMR-derived information from the input data. 
Three supervised ML algorithms—gradient boosting regressor (GBR), adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), multilayer perceptron (MLP)—as well as radial basis function (RBF) neural network, group method of data handling (GMDH), and residual dense neural network (Res DNN) are utilized and evaluated. 
Additionally, a modified two-dimensional CNN, named Residual 2D-CNN, is developed, fed with artificial 2D feature maps generated from available conventional logs. 
The comparison of each model's output with the permeability derived from NMR logs demonstrates the efficacy of nonlinear machine and deep learning techniques in estimating NMR permeability.
